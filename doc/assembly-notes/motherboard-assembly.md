# Motherboard Assembly Notes

- All fine-pitch components on are front side
- LED polarity mark goes toward silkscreen cathode mark (thick line)
	- Also: silkscreen arrow always points toward polarity (cathode) mark
- Power LEDs:
	- (amber) = VBUS\_IN (5V)
	- (white) = +5V rail good
	- (green) = +3.3V rail good
- When placing J3, make sure pins on bottom line up with pads!  Connector can only go one way.
